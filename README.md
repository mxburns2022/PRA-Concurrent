# Data and Scripts for "Limitations in Parallel Ising Machine Networks: Theory and Practice"
Julia scripts to run the small-scale Wasserstein experiments are contained in `par_im/*`. GSet experiments were run using a separate C++ code on a HPC cluster, however the data is included in `data/*`. The scripts used to produce plots are located in `notebooks/*`. 

Please pardon our dust, documentation is a work in progress
